FindSmells 1.0 is a tool for detecting bad smells from XML files with computed software metrics. 
The tool aims to provide flexible, detection since strategies may be composed by the user and run 
without the source code of the system under analysis. FindSmells  allows management of detection 
strategies through a data base, and provides the export of detection results. Therefore, the tool 
may support the development team in assessing software quality.\n\n
